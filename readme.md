# Scentric, a responsive development system for Wordpress

## Overview

* Switched the reset from Blueprint's to Normalize.css, which is superior for developer tools and arguably for developers too
* Switched some of the header elements over to Boilerplate style and CSS style as well


From the original theme documentation:

* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in inc/custom-header.php that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found the comments of inc/custom-header.php to your header.php template.
* Custom template tags in inc/template-tags that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Sample theme options in /inc/theme-options/ that can can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php.
* Some small tweaks in /inc/tweaks.php that can improve your theming experience. They can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php.
* Keyboard navigation for image attachment templates. The script can be found in js/keyboard-navigation.js. It’s enqueued in functions.php.
* A script at js/small-menu.js that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It’s enqueued in functions.php.
* 5 sample CSS layouts in /layouts: Two sidebars on the left, two sidebars on the right, a sidebar on either side of your content, and two-column layouts with sidebars on either side.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in style.css that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* The GPL license in license.txt. :) Use it to make something cool.
